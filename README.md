# IT Management System 
## ProOktatas C# Developer bootcamp - 1.Modul (basics)

### **_Introduction_**
During the 7 months C# "Basics" module, I have learned the basics of C# and WinForms applications.The project itself is a storage manager system for computer parts.

### **_Used Technologies_**
1. C#
2. MySQL

## **_The project itself_**
 Users can add and delete computer components across various storage units, apply filters for efficient organization, and even create new computer parts from a selection of 5 types. Additionally, there's a handy CSV export-import function for data transfer. 

**Aim of the Project**

The main objective of this project is to create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that enables the client to track its storage. The client can choose from 5 different computer parts and add new parts in the system or delete one. These computer parts can be connected to a given storage, where their in stock piece needs to be given. From the given storage each part can be added more or deleted some. It is possible to export the given computer part and then import it.

**Challenges within the project**
One distinctive approach I took was in designing the database structure. Instead of creating separate tables for each of the 5 types (as we did during the course), I opted for a more general approach. I split the information into a value table, which holds the actual product values with general column names, and a description table, detailing the properties of each column. This design choice allows for a more flexible and scalable system (hopefully).

## **_What have I learned_**
1. Tons of OOP approach
2. Database structure
3. C#
4. MySQL
